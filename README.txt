A javascript / Jquery app built with some material design lite elements that uses ip-api for location without needing user

premissions which in turn feeds the lat / long information into OpenWeatherMaps API. The returned icon code is returned from

OpenWeatherMaps and matched to the the correct OwFont Weather Icon from the Owfont kit. Simple logic added to show only the

daytime icon set from 6am to 7pm depending on what is returned from Javascript Date object.
